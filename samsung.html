         <p>Samsung's Beginnings</p>
         <p style=" max-width: 95em;"> With only 30,000 won (about US$27), Lee Byung-chul started Samsung as a trading company based in a city called Taegu in 1938. With 40 employees, Samsung began as a grocery store, trading and exporting goods produced in and around the city. It sold dried Korean fish and vegetables, as well as its own noodles.
        
        
        The meaning of the word Samsung is "three stars," with the number three representing "something powerful."
        
        The company grew and expanded to Seoul in 1947 but left when the Korean War broke out. Following the war, Lee started a sugar refinery in Busan before expanding into textiles and building what was, at the time, the largest woolen mill in Korea.
        
        This early diversification became a successful growth strategy for Samsung, which rapidly expanded into the insurance, securities, and retail businesses. After the war, Samsung focused on the redevelopment of Korea, especially industrialization.
        
        
           <p>1960 to 1980</p> 
        In the 1960s, Samsung entered the electronics industry with the formation of several electronics-focused divisions:
        
       <p> Samsung Electronics Devices</p>
       <p>Samsung Electro-Mechanics</p> 
       <p>Samsung Corning</p> 
       <p> Samsung Semiconductor & Telecommunications</p>
        During this period, Samsung acquired DongBang Life Insurance and established Joong-Ang Development (now known as Samsung Everland). Additionally, a Samsung-Sanyo partnership began, paving the way for the production of TVs, microwaves, and other consumer products.
        
        
        In 1970, Samsung-Sanyo produced its first black and white TVs and expanded its reach into shipbuilding, petrochemicals, and aircraft engines. Over the next decade, Samsung also produced transistor black and white TVs, color TVs, refrigerators, electric desk calculators, and air conditioners. In 1978, the company reached the landmark of having produced 5 million TVs.
        
        By 1974, Samsung Heavy Industries was one of the largest shipbuilders in the world. In the late 1970s, the company established Samsung Electronics America and the Suwon R&D Center.
        
        <p>1980 to 2000</p>
        In 1980, Samsung entered the telecommunications hardware industry with the purchase of Hanguk Jeonja Tongsin. Initially building telephone switchboards, Samsung expanded into telephone and fax systems, which eventually shifted to mobile phone manufacturing.
        
        In the early 1980s, Samsung expanded to Germany, Portugal, and New York. In 1982, Samsung Printing Solutions was founded. This subsidiary of the company delivered digital solutions to the printing industry. The following year, the company started producing personal computers, and in 1984 Samsung's sales reached one trillion won.
        
        Later in the decade, Samsung expanded to Tokyo and the United Kingdom, positioning itself as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing with massive production of 256K DRAM.
        
        In 1987, founder Lee Byung-chul passed away, and his son, Lee Kun-hee, assumed control of Samsung. Soon after that, Samsung Semiconductor and Telecommunications merged with Samsung Electronics. The merged organization focused on home appliances, telecommunications, and semiconductors.
        
        The next decade brought additional growth and achievements. Samsung soon became a world leader in chip production, formed Samsung Motors, and began producing digital TVs. The company also began investing heavily in the design and manufacture of components for other companies. It sought to become the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturer.
        
        Samsung Ventures was founded in 1999 to invest in startup companies focusing on many of Samsung's core services.
        
        <p>2000 to Present</p>
        Samsung entered the phone market with the SPH-1300, an early touch-screen prototype released in 2001. The company also developed the first speech-recognition phone in 2005.
        
        In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Samsung acquired companies that developed technologies for electronic devices. In 2011, Samsung released the Galaxy S II, followed in 2012 by the Galaxy S III, one of the world's most popular smartphones. The year 2012 also marked Samsung becoming the world's largest mobile phone maker and the acquisition of mSpot to provide entertainment to Samsung device users.
        
        The company made additional acquisitions in the following years, including organizations that would help it expand its offerings in medical technology, smart TVs, OLED displays, home automation, printing solutions, cloud solutions, payment solutions, and artificial intelligence.
        
        In September 2014, Samsung announced the Gear VR, a virtual reality device developed for use with the Galaxy Note 4. By 2015, Samsung had more U.S. patents approved than any other company, with more than 7,500 utility patents granted before the end of the year.
        
        In 2017, Samsung was given governmental permission to test a self-driving car. The following year, Samsung announced that it would expand its renewable energy plans and hire 40,000 employees over the next three years.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family:blackadder ITC;">samsung A72</h1>
     <p style="max-width: 95em;">LONDON — Samsung debuted three mid-range smartphones on Wednesday, including one with 5G support, hoping to lure in people with less cash to spare as competition in the mobile industry intensifies.

        The new phones are part of Samsung’s budget Galaxy A range, which has become a popular brand with Samsung customers put off by high prices in the firm’s flagship Galaxy S lineup.
        
        Samsung is aiming to reclaim its position as the world’s top smartphone manufacturer after Apple took that title in the fourth quarter of 2020. Apple’s new iPhone 12 is the company’s first model to come with 5G capability.
        
        Samsung is launching three new models: the Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G and Galaxy A72. The new lineup is an upgrade from last year’s Galaxy A51 and A71 handsets. The A52 5G is the only device out of the three to support superfast 5G internet. It’ll retail at 429 euros ($510), making it a more affordable alternative to Apple’s iPhone 12 Mini.

        <p>Specs and features</p>
        The South Korean electronics giant says its new phones come with a number of improvements on their predecessors, including a better screen, camera and battery life.
        
        The Galaxy A52 features a bright 6.5-inch display while the Galaxy A72 has a 6.7-inch panel. The Galaxy A52 5G includes a 120Hz refresh rate, which basically means you’ll be able to scroll more smoothly. The entry Galaxy A52 and more expensive A72 models feature a 90Hz refresh rate.
        
        Samsung says it’s taken eye strain into account, including a feature that automatically adjusts the display color temperature depending on the way a person uses their phone. There’s also a music-sharing setting that lets users sync their phone to a friend’s device to connect to a Bluetooth speaker without having to link directly with the speaker.
        
        All three phones contain a quad camera with a 64-megapixel main lens. The Galaxy A72 features 3x optical zoom, which Samsung says will let users take a photo from a 10-meter distance that looks like it’s been taken just three meters away.
        
        Another key camera feature on the new Galaxy A lineup is Fun Mode, which was developed in partnership with Snap. It’s a tool in Samsung’s native camera app that lets you add Snapchat filters to your pictures and videos.
        
        Samsung also touted better battery life with its new handsets, promising two days of usage without having to worry about charging the phones. The A52 and A52 5G come with a 4,500mAH battery while the A72 has a larger 5,000mAH battery.

        <p>Price and release date</p>
        Samsung’s Galaxy A52 will retail at 349 euros ($415), while the A52 5G and A72 will set you back 429 euros and 449 euros, respectively.
        
        Samsung hasn’t yet given an international release date for the new phones but said they’ll launch in the U.S. sometime in April.
        
        “This new line-up represents a significant step in performance and features,” Paolo Pescatore, tech, media and telco analyst at PP Foresight, told CNBC.
        
        “The most notable standout features are the impressive screen including the high refresh rate and far longer battery life.”
        
        Samsung’s new budget phones could tempt people who aren’t prepared to pay $1,000 or more for a premium Android or iPhone model.
        
        “The launch is timely and comes at an interesting time given the slew of new smartphone launches,” said Pescatore.
        
        “While there is huge excitement with the arrival of new smartphones, competition in the mid-tier is intense. Samsung has done a good job of packing in, premium sought after features (some from its flagship S21 device) at punchy prices.” </p>

<h3 style="font-family:blackadder ITC;">samsung S21</h3>
<p style="max-width: 95em;">Samsung Galaxy S21 series is now official. After a plethora of leaks, rumours, and teasers, the new flagship range of smartphones have finally been launched by the South Korean giant at its Galaxy Unpacked 2021 event. The new series continues the company's tradition of bringing three distinct models in its flagship smartphone series — just like the Galaxy S20 series launched last year. The Galaxy S21 family consists of the regular Galaxy S21 as well as the Galaxy S21+ and the Galaxy S21 Ultra. All three models come with an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate and flaunt an all-new camera housing that Samsung calls “Contour Cut Camera”. The Galaxy S21 and the Galaxy S21+ in the series share an identical triple rear camera setup, while the Galaxy S21 Ultra houses a superior, quad rear camera setup with a 108-megapixel primary sensor. The Galaxy S21 Ultra also comes with S Pen support. The entire Galaxy S21 series includes an IP68-rated for dust and water resistance. 

    Samsung Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra price, availability details
    Samsung Galaxy S21 price in India has been set at Rs. 69,999 for the base 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant, while the 256GB storage option's price tag is Rs. 73,999.

    Pre-orders start from January 15, and pre-order customers will get a Galaxy SmartTag, also launched at the event, and a Rs. 10,000 Samsung Shop voucher, redeemable against a Galaxy Watch Active 2 or a Galaxy Buds+ with a Travel Adapter. Cashback of up to Rs. 10,000 will be available for HDFC Bank customers.

<p style="max-width: 95em;">Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S21 family of Android phones on Thursday.

    There are three models, each with a larger screen than the last: the Galaxy S21, the Galaxy S21+ and the Galaxy S21 Ultra. All support the range of 5G networks now available in the U.S. and are the first devices powered by Qualcomm’s new flagship Snapdragon 888 processor that was announced last month.
    
    Samsung remains the world’s largest phone maker with 22.7% of the market, according to the latest figures from IDC. A large portion of its sales comes from lower-cost models, but Samsung competes against Apple in the U.S. with its high-end Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series phones. These are the phones that will go toe-to-toe with Apple’s new iPhone 12 series and they look like the best option for folks who prefer Android over an iPhone and who want the latest cameras and processors. The S21 Ultra has better cameras than the other versions, too, at least on paper. It has a sharper front-facing camera and four additional cameras on the back, as opposed to three on the S21 and S21+, including two zoom lenses, an ultra-wide lens and a wide-angle lens. The Galaxy S21 and S21+ lack the additional zoom lens. The Ultra also supports up to 100x zoom versus 30x zoom on the other models.

    The Galaxy S21 will start at $799.99 and the Galaxy S21+ starts at $999.99. The Galaxy S21 Ultra starts at $1,199.99. All phones are now available for preorder and will be released on Jan. 29.
